# Homepage

This project is a simple, standalone, self-hosted PHP page that is meant to be your window to your server and the web. 

All the assets needed are part of the repo so it can run offline (though it won't fetch pretty background images for you). 

This project uses:
- jQuery
- Bootstrap CSS
- Mousetrap.js
- Font Awesome
- Unsplash

## To Use
Copy the config.sample.json file and rename to config.json. Be sure to update the fields as you see appropriate. Note that you will need to create a developer profile at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) to use the background image functionality properly.
